Simulation of Global Trade Dynamics using Agent-Based Modeling and GPT-4 Integration

# Technical Whitepaper: A Simulation of Global Trade Dynamics using Agent-Based Modeling and GPT-4 Integration

## 1. Introduction and Abstract

In an era where global trade policies and their implications are becoming increasingly complex, a detailed and dynamic simulation tool can provide invaluable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and researchers. This whitepaper presents an innovative simulation framework designed to model global trade dynamics, political decision-making, and economic outcomes using a combination of agent-based modeling (ABM) and GPT-4 large language model (LLM) integration. 

Our simulation uses real-world economic, political, and social data from a variety of authoritative sources to create agents representing governments, companies, consumers, and intermediaries. These agents act according to data-driven "disposition matrices" (scenario-action probability tables) and "modifier matrices" (relation modifiers) that are partially generated by GPT-4 based on relevant context. Through iterative simulation steps, the model explores a wide range of probable future scenarios over a six-month horizon, updating policies and outcomes in response to changing conditions such as trade volumes, political climates, economic indicators, public sentiment, and upcoming elections.

This whitepaper comprehensively describes the data sources used (including UN Comtrade, World Bank, IMF, WTO, GTA, USITC, Trading Economics, U.S. Census Bureau, political data from Wikipedia, and more), the variables ingested from these sources, the agent-based modeling framework, and the integration of GPT-4 to drive agent behaviors and scenario generation. It details how scenario branching is performed to capture different future possibilities and how we measure outcomes for scenario selection, iteration, and further simulations.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### 2.1 Need for Advanced Trade Simulations

Global trade dynamics and policies are influenced by a wide range of economic, political, and social factors. Traditional modeling approaches often rely on static or simplified assumptions that do not adequately capture the complexity and interplay of factors affecting international trade. Our simulation model addresses these complexities by combining detailed data-driven approaches with advanced agent-based modeling, allowing for realistic and adaptive policymaking simulations.

### 2.2 Integrating Agent-Based Modeling and GPT-4

Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a framework where individual agents, representing countries, companies, and consumers, interact with each other and evolve based on defined rules and behaviors. GPT-4, a large language model, can enhance ABM by dynamically generating decision rules (actions and outcomes) based on scenarios extracted from real-world data. GPT-4 can synthesize complex datasets into coherent strategies and policies that government agents might realistically undertake, providing a more human-like decision-making process within the simulation.

### 2.3 Goals of the Simulation

The primary goals of this simulation framework are to:

- Predict how changes in tariffs, trade agreements, or political climates affect global trade volumes and economic outcomes.
- Evaluate the influence of political scenarios, like upcoming elections or political scandals, on policy decisions and their consequent economic impacts.
- Explore how public sentiment shifts, driven by real-time news and social media data, can influence government policies.
- Provide a range of plausible scenarios and outcomes by branching through various future events and measures of trade volume, ensuring robust scenario analysis for policymakers and stakeholders.

### 3.2 Data Processing and Integration

A Data Acquisition module systematically fetches data from these sources, handles rate limits, concurrency, and data validation. The Data Processing module subsequently cleans, normalizes, and stores this data in a structured format suitable for the simulation. Key steps include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data types are consistent.
- **Data Validation**: Checking data ranges and consistency across sources.
- **Integration**: Merging data from various sources into unified structures (e.g., a combined dataframe for economic indicators per country).
- **Normalization**: Transforming different metrics and units into a unified format (e.g., converting currency units or normalizing sentiment scales).

This processed data is then ready to initialize agents in the simulation, as well as to update the scenario and decision logic as the simulation progresses.

## 4. Core Innovation: LLM-Based Agent Behavior and Scenario-Driven Decision Logic

### 4.1 Government Agent Dispositions and Decision Logic

Each Government Agent in the simulation is assigned dispositions and decision-making rules that determine their policy actions. These rules are captured in two key matrices:

1. **Disposition Matrix (Scenario-Action Probability Table)**:
   - **Description**: This matrix outlines how likely a government is to perform a particular action under different scenarios.
   - **Columns**:
     - *Decision_ID*: Unique identifier for each decision.
     - *Action*: The policy action to be considered (e.g., "Increase Tariffs", "Form Trade Alliances").
     - *Scenario*: The scenario in which this action might be taken (e.g., "Recession", "Upcoming Elections").
     - *Probability(%)*: The probability (in percentage) that the government will take this action if the given scenario applies.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     ### Disposition Matrix
     Decision_ID,Action,Scenario,Probability(%)
     1,Increase Tariffs,Recession,70
     2,Form Trade Alliances,Economic Boom,50
     3,Finalize Trade Agreements,Trade Deficit Increase,60
     4,Decrease Tariffs,Economic Boom,30
     5,Implement Subsidies,Recession,40
     6,Implement Climate Change Policies,Climate Change Policies,80
     7,Launch Election Campaign,Upcoming Elections,75
     8,Handle Political Scandal,Political Scandals,65
     9,Address Public Protests,Public Protests,55
     10,Enhance Disaster Response,Natural Disasters,60
     ```

2. **Modifier Matrix (Relation Modifier Table)**:
   - **Description**: This matrix adjusts the probabilities of actions based on relationships, alliances, and other contextual factors.
   - **Columns**:
     - *Relation_Type*: The type of relation (e.g., "Alliance", "Industry").
     - *Relation_Name*: The name of the related entity or industry.
     - *Scenario*: The scenario to which the relation applies.
     - *Modifier_Value*: The numeric modifier (positive or negative) to apply to the base probability. For example, `0.10` represents a 10% increase and `-0.05` represents a 5% decrease.
   - **Example**:
     ```
     ### Modifier Matrix
     Relation_Type,Relation_Name,Scenario,Modifier_Value
     Alliance,EU,Recession,0.05
     Alliance,CAN,Economic Boom,0.10
     Industry,Automotive,Recession,0.15
     Industry,Technology,Climate Change Policies,-0.10
     ```

### 4.2 GPT-4 Integration for Disposition Matrices

GPT-4 is used to generate these scenario-action probability and modifier tables. Specifically:

- **Context Extraction**: For each government agent (country and political party), a detailed context JSON string is created. This context includes:
  - Economic indicators (like GDP and trade percentages) sourced from the World Bank and other economic data providers.
  - Political climate information (party ideologies, upcoming elections, current policies).
  - Public sentiment derived from news and social media data.
  - Legislative context and trade alliance information.
- **GPT-4 Prompting**: Using this context, GPT-4 is given a predefined template prompt to produce:
  1. A **Disposition Matrix** with scenario-action probabilities, considering the party's ideology, current policies, and economic/political context.
  2. A **Modifier Matrix** indicating how specific relationships (alliances, industries) influence the probability of actions under various scenarios.

1,Increase Tariffs,Recession,70
2,Decrease Tariffs,Economic Boom,30
3,Implement Subsidies,Recession,50
4,Form Trade Alliances,Upcoming Elections,60

...
```

and

```
### Modifier Matrix
Relation_Type,Relation_Name,Scenario,Modifier_Value
Alliance,CAN,Economic Boom,0.10
Industry,Technology,Climate Change Policies,-0.10
...
```

### 4.4 Application of Disposition and Modifier Matrices

1. **Scenario and Probability Calculation**:
   - The simulation identifies current active scenarios based on economic and political data.
   - For each government agent, the relevant subset of their disposition matrix is selected.
   - The base probability of each action is derived for each scenario.

2. **Relation Modifiers**:
   - The modifier matrix is applied to adjust these probabilities based on alliances (like with Canada), industries impacted by policies (like automotive or technology), and other relationships.
   - For example, if an agent has a strong alliance with Canada and an "Economic Boom" scenario, a `0.10` (10% increase) modifier might increase the base probability of certain actions like forming trade alliances.

3. **Action Decision**:
   - The final adjusted probabilities are used to determine which actions the agent will implement stochastically. For instance, if an "Increase Tariffs" action has a 70% probability under "Recession" scenario and alliance modifiers add 5%, the final probability might be 75%.

### 4.5 Example: Generating and Using the Tables

For the Democratic Party of the USA (given the context of a mild recession, upcoming elections, and alliances):
- **GPT-4 Output**: 
  - A disposition matrix listing probabilities for various actions under relevant scenarios.
  - A modifier matrix showing how alliances and industries adjust these probabilities.
- **Simulation Step**:
  - If the scenario is "Recession" and the "Increase Tariffs" action has a 70% base probability:
    - If the alliance with the EU in a recession scenario adds a 5% modifier, the final probability is `70% + 5% = 75%`.
  - The government agent may then decide to "Increase Tariffs" with a 75% chance in that step.

## 5. Agent-Based Modeling with Data-Driven and Scenario-Driven Logic

### 5.1 Agent Types and Behaviors

1. **Government Agents**:
   - Represent countries and their policies.
   - Have disposal and modifier matrices that guide actions under different scenarios.
   - Adjust policies like tariffs, subsidies, trade alliances, and spending based on economic indicators, political pressures, and public sentiment.

2. **Company Agents**:
   - Represent businesses in different sectors (e.g., manufacturing, technology).
   - Decisions influenced by government policies (like tariffs), production capacity, financial health, and market demand.
   - They adjust sourcing (domestic vs. imported) and production according to changing trade policies and economic conditions.
   - Might invest in industries to increase competitiveness or adapt to new policies.

3. **Consumer Agents**:
   - Represent individual or aggregate consumer behavior.
   - Adjust consumption preferences based on income level, tariffs on imported goods, and other economic conditions.
   - For instance, if tariffs on imported luxury goods rise, consumers might shift towards domestic alternatives.

4. **Intermediary Agents**:
   - Represent entities like logistics providers and financial institutions that facilitate trade.
   - Their services and costs can influence how companies and governments operate within global supply chains.

### 5.2 Detailed Agent Logic

**GovernmentAgentEnhanced**:
- **Economic_indicators**: Values like GDP, trade deficit, GDP growth used in scenario determination.
- **Political_data**: Includes party ideology, upcoming election dates, public sentiment, and how these may influence decision probabilities.
- **Disposition_matrix & modifier_matrix**: Determine action probabilities under given scenarios, adjusting for relationships like alliances or industry support.

**CompanyAgent**:
- **Production_capacity & financial_health**: Track health and capabilities. If demand is high, a company increases production. If demand falls, production might decrease.
- **Supply_chain**: Decides whether to source domestically or internationally, factoring in tariffs and trade policies.
- **Invest_in_industry**: At random intervals, invests in improving financial health or production capacity.

**ConsumerAgent**:
- **Income_level**: Affects the ratio of spending on essential vs. luxury goods.
- **Demand_preferences**: Adjusted by policy changes (like tariffs on imports) and economic conditions. For instance, higher tariffs on imports might lead to increased demand for domestic goods.

### 5.3 The Simulation Model Architecture

**TradeModelEnhanced**:
- Brings all agents together in a simulation environment.
- Gathers processed data for each country, initializes agents with relevant data.
- Each step: 
  - Government agents decide policies.
  - Company agents adjust production, sourcing, and investments.
  - Consumer agents adjust consumption preferences.
- Each batch of steps: 
  - The model collects data (like trade volume).
  - Identifies scenarios (like average or outlier outcomes).
- Introduces new events (like future news or policies) to simulate evolving conditions.

### 5.4 Example Agent Interactions

A simplified example:
- A GovernmentAgent faces a "Recession" scenario. 
  - The disposition matrix gives a 70% base probability for "Increase Tariffs".
  - The modifier matrix (like alliance with EU giving a 5% increase) raises it to 75%. 
  - The government decides to increase tariffs.
- CompanyAgent sees an increase in tariffs on imports:
  - Company might shift sourcing from imported to domestic resources to avoid higher import costs.
- ConsumerAgent experiences higher prices on imported luxury goods:
  - If tariffs significantly raise these prices, consumers shift consumption, influencing future production decisions of CompanyAgents.

## 6. Simulation Process and Scenario Analysis

### 6.1 The Step-by-Step Simulation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Agents are created with data from sources (economic indicators, political climates).
   - Government agent's disposition and modifier matrices are generated by GPT-4 using the initial data context.
   - Company and consumer agents set up with initial parameters (production capacity, demand preferences).

2. **Single Simulation Step**:
   - Government agents:
     - Assess current scenario.
     - Determine actions (like adjusting tariffs) using their disposition and modifier matrices.
     - Implement chosen actions.
   - Company agents:
     - Observe changes in policies (like tariff changes).
     - Adjust sourcing and production capacity accordingly.
     - Possibly invest in capacity to improve financial health.
   - Consumer agents:
     - Adjust consumption preferences based on new government policies.
   - Intermediary agents:
     - Provide services (like adjusting shipping rates or financial products) based on the scenario.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - After each step, the model collects metrics such as trade volume, average tariff rates, and others for analysis and scenario determination.

4. **Batch Simulation**:
   - The model runs for several steps (e.g., 50 steps to simulate 6 months).
   - At the end of the batch, the model analyzes outcomes:
     - **Mean and Median outcomes**: The average/median scenario.
     - **1 Sigma Scenarios**: Scenarios around one standard deviation from the mean.
     - **High-Impact Outliers**: Scenarios beyond two standard deviations.

5. **Scenario Branching**:
   - Based on identified outcomes, the model creates branches for plausible future scenarios:
     - For the mean scenario, 1-sigma scenarios, and outlier scenarios.
   - For each scenario branch:
     - The model uses GPT-4 to generate updated disposition and modifier matrices given the new scenario context.
     - Agents continue the simulation for the next batch of steps.

### 6.2 Detailed Scenario Branching Logic

**Example**:
- After the first 6-month simulation:
  - The average trade volume scenario (`Mean Outcome`) is \$1 trillion.
  - A 1-sigma scenario is \$1.1 trillion.
  - Another 1-sigma scenario is \$0.9 trillion.
  - An outlier scenario might be \$1.2 trillion.

**Branching**:
- The simulation creates branches:
  1. **Mean scenario** (Trade volume \$1 trillion)
  2. **1 Sigma Above** scenario (Trade volume \$1.1 trillion)
  3. **1 Sigma Below** scenario (Trade volume \$0.9 trillion)
  4. **High-Impact Outlier** scenario (Trade volume \$1.2 trillion)

For each branch:
- GPT-4 is provided an updated context (like which scenario is unfolding) and asked to generate new disposition and modifier matrices.
- The model reinitializes with these updated matrices and runs another batch of simulation steps.

### 6.3 Iteration and Depth of Simulation

The simulation is designed to run multiple batches to cover a certain horizon (e.g., 6 months per batch for a total horizon of 2.5 years or 5 batches):
- **Total Batches**: 5.
- **Steps per Batch**: Each batch may run for 50 steps, simulating daily or weekly increments within a 6-month period.
- **Branching Depth**: Up to a maximum depth of 3 scenario branches to avoid combinatorial explosion.

At each branching step, the simulation explores different plausible futures, updating conditions and decisions. This branching allows the model to explore a variety of future states and their likelihood.

### 6.4 Integration of Future Events using GPT-4

At the end of each batch:
- The simulation identifies key outcomes and possible future events (like new trade deals, changes in public sentiment, or political shifts).
- GPT-4 generates plausible future news articles and social media posts reflecting these outcomes and sentiments.
- These future events are scheduled into the model to update agent decision-making in subsequent steps, reflecting dynamic changes in the environment over time.
